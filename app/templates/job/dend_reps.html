  <h2>Dendrogram of Representative OTUs</h2>

  <p>
    Correlating Beta diversity dendrograms with environmental annotations is
    motivated by the idea that similar environments select their constituents in
    similar ways. Hover mouse on sample to see the details of EnvO, Study,
    Sample depth, Source and Ecosystem. Each sample have color(s) rectangles to
    distinguish their ecosystem(s). This Dendrogram is created using the User
    Sample (in RED) against all the representatives of the reference database.
